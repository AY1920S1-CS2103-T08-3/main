<div class="paragraph">
<p>Powerlifting Competition Coordinator is a free application for powerlifting competition event organizers
that is simple, fast, and easy to use. It is targeted at organizers of small to medium sized powerlifting
competitions who require a hassle-free way of managing and tracking the lifts of participants in and out
of the powerlifting competitions. During competition mode, the system has real time maintenance of athlete
rankings within their respective weight classes allowing the organizer track the participants'
standings at all times throughout the duration of the competition. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 1</strong>: added <strong>the ability to support the many-to-many relationships between the competitions
and persons</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to create participations (i.e. a person takes part in a particular
competition) that can be store and retrieved from the JSON storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have flexibility over
the number of people participating in a particular competition while persisting their respective
competition results in the JSON storage for future reference and use. Data of athletes over various
competitions can be tracked and used to track performance across time and competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: Given the original architecture of address book, saving association classes was not
immediately enabled as the storage that was intended was mainly for entities
with a one-to-one/one-to-many relationship and definitely not a many-to-many relationship.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, one of which was to possible store the data in XML form, since using a
database was not allowed for the project. I did not user the XML storage as it would require too
much time to implement. The modification of the JSON storage was still challenging as it required a deep
understanding of the underlying JSON storage infrastructure and how everything was saved in order to
be able to save the association class properly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 2</strong>: added *the ability to enter and exit a competition session (i.e. context switching)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: controls user actions/commands depending on the context that the application is in (i.e.
whether a competition is in ongoing/in-session)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly even though we have actually limited
user actions depending on the context of the application. The control of the user flow actually focuses
the user to performing the right actions during the competition session and hence, optimizes the user to perform
the necessary commands on the application to record the results of the competition as efficiently as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future as the context
limits what kind of commands can be done at any one point of time.
This required an in-depth analysis of understanding of how powerlifting competitions function and how the
user flow could be optimized for efficient recording of competition results, especially since delays in powerlifting
competitions can be very unprofessional and damaging to the reputation of the user who is organizing this event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 3</strong>: added *the ability to give a ranking of the athletes using different ranking methods</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to list the participations in a selected competition in a sorted order
as determined by the rank method (i.e. overall score or maximum weight lifted for a given exercise like
bench press or squat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as competitions are only relevant if we
can determine a winner and track relative performance. This feature is therefore central to the application
as it gives the user and therefore, the participants of the competition knowledge of their standings among their fellow
competitors. This encourages their competitive spirit and adds to the excitement of the competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement gives extreme flexibility and extensibility to future ranking methods
that need to be added in the future as the developer can just add a new ranking methods and scoring function in
order to use this new ranking methods to order the participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Used java generics to support the various lists of entities and is therefore extensible
for additional entities to be added should a developer require</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Updated the user interface to support 3 different lists</p>
