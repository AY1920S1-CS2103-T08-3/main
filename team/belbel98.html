<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 1</strong>: Added ability to handle competition sessions</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Allows the user to start or resume a competition session, generate the next and following
lifters/attempts in a pre-determined order, and update the success of the attempt accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This is one of the main features of PCC, to allow event organisers have a smooth flow of their
competition event, and perform minimal functionality (under what it does) during the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement comes in many small parts: designing the <code>Session</code> component as a singleton class;
creating appropriate dependencies to reduce coupling to main components such as <code>Partipation</code> or <code>Attempt</code>;
adding the relevant commands for this session handling to work on the user-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was challenging to implement as there are many different types of scenarios that can happen during a session,
and i needed to handle it well with proper exception handling to ensure a smooth flow of the competition event.
A deep understanding of the general flow of powerlifting competitions is necessary.
Furthermore, since the main components need to be updated along with the session,
it required an in-depth analysis of how the logic works with the model components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some concepts that i have learnt from CS2103 and have applied in this enhancement are:
Single Responsibility Principle and Singleton Class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 2</strong>: Added ability to CRUD Participation, the association class between Person and Competition.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Allows the user to create, read, update, and delete Participation-related information and objects.
It includes some user-end commands such as creation of participations with a list of 9 attempts,
list participation according to an existing competition, as well as deletion. Some other functions of this enhancement
include the adding and updating of attempts, and also the tabulation of scores which is used in other contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: These commands allow the user to CRUD the association between a Person and Competition into a
Participation. This is also an important feature so that the Participation can be properly prepared and updated before,
during and after a competition session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: For these features and commands on the user-end to work, the Participation association class and
its dependencies need to be well set up, such that there is not too much coupling in the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">

<h3 id="context-switching-feature-between-sessions"><a class="link" href="#context-switching-feature-between-sessions">Context-Switching feature between sessions</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our features are mainly split into 2 contexts. An in-competition, and an out-of-competition session mode.
A session is started when the user wants to start an existing competition to call lifters to perform their attempt,
record them, and finally to view the ranking leader board for the competition, all within in-session mode.
On the other hand, an out-session mode, when the user exits the competition session mode,
is where all create, read, update delete of the Person, Competition, and Participation is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason for this context-switching feature is to prevent users from using out-session commands that are strictly for
in-session mode and vice versa.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The activity diagram above shows the average user flow of how the user can go in-session,
and also distinctly shows the commands that can be done in each state.
However, the end of every competition session does not signify the end of a user&#8217;s activity.
The user can still go in and out of the competition session (start and end), to perform the different commands
from the different states.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="how-it-is-being-implemented"><a class="link" href="#how-it-is-being-implemented">How it is being implemented</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is done using an instance of the Session class, which is exposed from the model manager.
The session has a competition field to indicate the current competition that is ongoing during the session.
If there is no competition set in the session, then there is no ongoing session. Using this simple
but highly effective method, we are able to use very simple logic to achieve the necessary context-switching behaviour
described in the above diagram.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="in-session"><a class="link" href="#in-session">In-Session</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In-Session is the state where the user enters competition mode, where users can command the app to generate
the next lifter, as well as record any attempt. At the end of the competition, the rank of the participants
and competition can be viewed too, as long as a competition session has yet to end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To handle the state of the competition, we have created a new <code>Session</code> class that is packaged into model and
managed by the ModelManager. The <code>Session</code> class is a singleton class, and only has one instance in the ModelManager.
The reason behind the use of a singleton class to handle sessions, is that we only want one ongoing session at any
point in time. The singleton class will also only temporarily store its participation list, and participationAttempt
list in relation to the ongoing session. Once the session ends, all data is reset.
Any update in any objects such as the attempts or participation details will be handled by the ModelManager,
which will be explained in more details in the respective features below.</p>

<h4 id="next-feature"><a class="link" href="#next-feature">Next feature</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the main purpose of the in-session function is to generate the next lifter and his attempt details accordingly.
In the <code>Session</code> class, the list of <code>ParticipationAttempt</code> is maintained so that athletes can make their attempt
in order of the type of lift, attempt number, and in increasing weight to be attempted. Upon calling the <code>next</code> command,
the next lifter is called up, and the following lifter should be asked to prepare for his lift, after the next lifter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>next</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is the example flow of what the model does when the <code>NextLifterCommand</code> is executed after being parsed
through the LogicManager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> A new <code>NextLifterCommand</code> is constructed when the user inputs <code>next</code> in the command box.
When <code>NextLifterCommand#execute()</code> is called, the model will get the following lifter, and store the
ParticipationAttempt retrieved from <code>Session#getFollowingLifter()</code> in a local variable,
to be returned together with the CommandResult later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The <code>ModelManager</code> will call <code>Session#NextLifter()</code> to generate the next lifter and attempt in the form of a
<code>ParticipationAttempt</code> object. If the <code>Session</code> is not prepared, which means that the imported <code>ParticipationAttempts</code>
are not sorted, <code>prepare()</code> will be called internally. When this method is called, the ParticipationAttempt list in the
Session will be sorted according to the new <code>ParticipationAttemptComparator</code>. When this is done, the session is now
prepared, and next or following lifters can be generated based on this sorted list.
(This method is usually called once just after starting the session.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The <code>Session#NextLifter()</code> method will then return the first <code>ParticipationAttempt</code> in the list.
This is equivalent to the next lifter to make his attempt, since he is the top most in the sorted list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A new <code>CommandResult</code> will be returned. Details of the next and following ParticipationAttempt will be
included and displayed in the Dialogue Box to the user.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we first implemented the session feature, the session can only be ended when a competition has ended,
which means there are no more attempts to be made. However, we have now made it such that the user can switch
between sessions as and when, even in the middle of the competition. This gives users more flexibility to switch between
session states, without worrying about the state of the competition.</p>

<h4 id="start-session-feature"><a class="link" href="#start-session-feature">Start Session feature</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The start session feature is a command to start a new competition session, when a user is not in competition state.
As mentioned in Section 4.2. above, <code>Session</code> allows the user to start any competition session as and when, even when a
competition has not ended (there are still attempts left to be made). To start a session, the user can enter
the command with the specified competition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>startSession c/COMPETITION_NAME</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is the flow of execution in the model after a <code>StartSessionCommand#execute()</code> is called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>Model#startSession(comp, partList)</code> is called, where <code>comp</code> is the <code>Competition</code> object to start the session
with, and <code>partList</code> is the list of <code>Participation</code> who will be participating in this competition session.
The method then calls <code>Session#start(comp, partList)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> An internal call in the <code>start()</code> method, <code>loadAttempts(p, p.getAttempts())</code>, is made for every
<code>Participation</code> object, <code>p</code>, by looping through the <code>partList</code>, loading all unattempted attempts into the
participationAttemptList temporarily stored in the Session instance.
(<code>p.getAttempts()</code> retrieves the list of all 9 <code>Attempt</code> instance that the participation has submitted at the start.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The <code>loadAttempts()</code> method will loop through all the 9 <code>Attempt</code> objects taken in as parameter, and checks if
each has been attempted. If an <code>Attempt</code> by that <code>Participation</code> has not been attempted, a new <code>ParticipationAttempt</code>
object will be created and added to the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the way <code>Session</code> handles the initialising of every new session, be it starting a new competition, resuming a
competition, or even starting a session with a competition that has already ended (all attempts have been made by the
athletes) is made possible.</p>
