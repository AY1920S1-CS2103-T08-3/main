== Introduction

A powerlifting competition/meet consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench and Deadlift. With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can.

This software is for organisers who organise powerlifting competitions. To facilitate the ease of data-entry, we have provided a command line interface that is augmented with a Graphical User Interface to help them better administer powerlifting competitions.


== Quick Start

Download the software from our git repo.
Ensure Java 11 is downloaded into your machine.

facilitate the competition session will be presented in order below:

This feature handles the entire flow of each session during Meet Day. It allows event organisers to submit an Athlete’s Squat, Bench, Deadlift attempts, as well as the success of their lifts. It will show the relevant information to prepare for the athletes lift (displaying name, weight, etc).
The flow of events, and the commands to facilitate the competition session will be presented in order below:

==== Prepare for a new session: `loadSess`
Loads the session of SBD lifts for the given name of the competition (provided it exists), separated by a space.
This will load all the athletes who are participating in this competition, and start the session associated with this competition.

Format: `loadSess COMPETITION_NAME`

Example:

* `loadSess Test of Strength 2019`

==== Submit attempts: `attempts`
Submits all 9 attempts for the 3 lifts, separating the lifts by a single space, and the attempts for each lift with a slash.

S is abbreviated for squat, B for bench, and D for deadlift. The numbers 1,2,3 represents the attempt number for that lift.
For example, S1 means squat attempt 1, and D3 means deadlift attempt 3.

Format: `attempts n/NAME s/S1/S2/S3 b/B1/B2/B3 d/D1/D2/D3`

Examples:

* `attempts n/farhannafahrid s/115/120/125 b/40/47.5/55 d/155/165/170`

* `attempts n/marcustay s/90/200/205 b/135/140/145 d/210/220/230`

==== Starts the session `start`
The session can be started after all participating athletes have submitted their 9 attempts for their 3 lifts.
This command will sort the athletes and the weight they are attempting in increasing order, after being sorted in this order:
Squat Attempts 1,2,3 , Bench Attempts 1,2,3 , Deadlift Attempts 1,2,3.

Format: `start`

Example:

* `start`

==== Update lift or no lift: `lift`
Updates whether the athlete succeeds in his attempt, or fails it.

Format: `lift n/NAME ATTEMPT_INDEX Y/N`

Examples:

* `lift n/christabel teo 8 N`

* `lift n/shawn koh 3 Y`

==== Get the next lifter in line: `next`
Retrieves the next lifter according to weight lifted for that attempt, the weights he/she is going for that particular lift and attempt.

Format: `next`

Example:

* `next`
