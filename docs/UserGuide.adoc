== Introduction

A powerlifting competition/meet consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench and Deadlift. With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can. 

This software is for organisers who organise powerlifting competitions. To facilitate the ease of data-entry, we have provided a command line interface that is augmented with a Graphical User Interface to help them better administer powerlifting competitions.


== Quick Start

Download the software from our git repo.
Ensure Java 11 is downloaded into your machine.

Format: `new wc/WEIGHTCLASS&GENDER`
GENDER is denoted by either M (male) or F (female)

Examples:

* `new u83M u93M` to create new sessions for male 83kg and male 93kg.
